Jones | One of America’s most profound artists finds his niche in depicting life in the Low Country islands of South Carolina and Georgia. Exploring the roots of African American history through the formerly enslaved inhabitants of these islands, John W. Jones brings to life the Gullah culture that still thrives today in the barrier islands along the Eastern seaboard. | http://barbados.org/art/babb.htm | untitled | http://barbados.org/art/babmrkt.gif | Fielding Babb | Fielding Babb has been around for many years. His work carries thirty years of maturity and he is now one of Barbados' most respected artists. In the 1960's Fielding found himself in a not so enviable position. As an artist it was hard to make ends meet. The Art movement at this time in Barbados had very little foundation and even less support. Fielding held on and has played an instrumental part in the growth of Fine Arts as we know it today (with art tours abroad, local support, growing respect for artist, more exposure and more art galleries). |

This California-based artist reimagines a bygone era in striking oil colors, and her love for the period shines through. To authentically paint Colonial America, Meadow spends a lot of time researching the period to make sure she portrays the details of the clothing, hair styles and home interiors of the era correctly. |

He is best known for his paintings depicting the lives of poor black emancipated slaves, especially sharecroppers in the post-Reconstruction American South. Walker continued painting until his death on January 3, 1921 in Charleston, where he is buried in the family plot at Magnolia Cemetery.
